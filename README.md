## Aim:

According to recent movies in the sites such as IDMB and Box office Mojo we can see the movies that are the most liked in the world are Black panther and Black Adams this are movies that belong to action packed genre in which they incorporate fictional characters where there is a protagonist and an antagonist which have powers and a story about how they came to be .
